## 1. JavaScript Operators:

Javascript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.

Examples:

- The Assignment Operator = assigns values
- The Addition Operator + adds values
- The Multiplication Operator \* multiplies values
- The Comparison Operator > compares values

## 2. JavaScript Assignment:

The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable:

Example:
let x = 10;

## 3. JavaScript Addition:

The Addition Operator (+) adds numbers:

let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;

## 4. JavaScript Multiplication:

The Multiplication Operator (\*) multiplies numbers:

let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x \* y;

| >=                   | Greater than or equal to          |
| <=                   | Less than or equal to             |

## 7. Logical Operators:

| ----------------- | ----------- |
| &&                | Logical and |
| \|\|              | Logical or  |
| !                 | Logical not |
